## 📁 Folder Structure

The project structure is simple and clean:

- `index.html` – Main HTML file with all page content
- `CSS/style.css` – Stylesheet with full theming and responsive design
- `images/` – Contains all visual assets (logo, chef images, meals, background)
- `fontawesome/` – Font Awesome files for icons (see below)

---

## ⚠️ Font Awesome Setup Notice

> Make sure the **Font Awesome** folder is included and **uncompressed** in your project before running.  
>  
> Do **not** link to a zipped or CDN-based copy unless you update the `index.html` path.  
>   
> For example, your folder should include:
>
> - `fontawesome-free-6.x.x/css/all.min.css`

And the path in your head HTML must correctly reflect this structure:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="fontawesome-free-6.x.x/css/all.min.css">
